# Project-NLP

To run the APIs correctly, make sure you are in the **root directory** of the project (`Project-NLP`), **not** inside the `apis` folder. Then use these commands:


You need to be in the root directory (Project-NLP) and open three terminal windows or tabs. Run each command in a separate terminal. Wait for each server to download the required dependencies and start running.
```bash
# Run Dawn's News API
python -m apis.dawns_news_api

# Run The News API
python -m apis.the_news_api

# Run Tribune News API
python -m apis.tribune_news_api


Once all servers are running, just open the index.html file in your browser to access the application.
